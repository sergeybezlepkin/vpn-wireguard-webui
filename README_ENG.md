# Starting the WireGuard VPN server with web-interface

[You can learn more about WireGuard here](https://goo.su/xKp8kj)

## VPS/VDS

You need a VPS/VDS server to run it. The server can be found [here](https://goo.su/IsDeUO), or [here for less than $3/month, or for a week for less than $1](https://vdska.ru/#vds_calc). The operating system is Ubuntu 20 or newer. To run a VPN server in a container, all you need is 1 core, 1 gigabyte of RAM, and 10 gigabytes or more of free space. After purchasing the server, you will be given credentials to log in to the server. How to log in to the terminal on the server can be found [here](https://goo.su/BBH9F).

# Ubuntu

### Install git, curl, nano and Docker

### Install git

```sh
sudo apt install -y git
```
### Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sergeybezlepkin/vpn-wireguard.git
```
### Go to the vpn-wireguard directory.
```sh
cd vpn-wireguard/
```
### Add execute permissions to the install_soft file and run it.
```sh
chmod +x install_soft
```
```sh
./install_soft
```

When installing and configuring the `iptables-persistent` package, you will need to answer the question: `Save current IPv4 rules? [yes/no]` answer `yes`, and to the second question: `Save current IPv6 rules? [yes/no]` answer `yes`.

> !After installation the server will be restarted!

## Edit the compose.yml file to start the VPN server

```sh
cd vpn-wireguard/
```
```sh
nano compose.yml
```

``File compose.yml``

```sh
version: “3.7”
services:
  wg-easy:
    image: ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy
    container_name: wg-easy
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - etc_wireguard:/etc/wireguard
    environment:
      - LANG=en
      - WG_HOST=
      - PASSWORD_HASH=
      - UI_TRAFFIC_STATS=true
      - UI_CHART_TYPE=3
      - WG_PORT=49888
      - PORT=48999
      - WG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS=10.45.0.x
      - WG_DEFAULT_DNS=1.1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8.8
      - WG_ALLOWED_IPS=0.0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
      - WG_PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVE=25
      # - WG_PRE_UP=echo “Pre Up” > /etc/wireguard/pre-up.txt
      # - WG_POST_UP=echo “Post Up” > /etc/wireguard/post-up.txt
      # - WG_PRE_DOWN=echo “Pre Down” > /etc/wireguard/pre-down.txt
      # - WG_POST_DOWN=echo “Post Down” > /etc/wireguard/post-down.txt
      - WG_ENABLE_ONE_TIME_LINKS=true
      - UI_ENABLE_SORT_CLIENTS=true
      - WG_ENABLE_EXPIRES_TIME=true
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    network_mode: host
volumes:
  etc_wireguard:
```

`Leave it open in the terminal, you need to add your own data. Open the second tab in the terminal. `

## Generate password hash.

```sh
cd vpn-wireguard/
```
```sh
cat hash
```
```sh
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy wgpw 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
```
After downloading and running the image, the terminal will display a HASH string, write the following 
> PASSWORD_HASH='$2a$12$o1s1n4ruKZ/2RbnVOUoHOutLY6raO4IDZv7/5z/Qh.K0UbA8RyaVG''.

Copy the obtained line into the environment variable `- PASSWORD_HASH=` in the file compose.yml. And it should be added after equal and without quotation marks. There are `$` characters in the hash-string, add one more next to the one we got from launching the image.
We get the result: `PASSWORD_HASH=$$$2a$$12$$$o1s1n4ruKZ/2RbnVOUOUoHOutLY6raO4IDZv7/5z/Qh.K0UbA8RyaVG`.

## Find your routable IP address

```sh
curl ifconfig.me
```
``or``
```sh
curl ipinfo.io
```

The received string with the address, add it to the environment variable `- WG_HOST=` after equals and without quotation marks. 

We get: `- WG_HOST=178.125.85.124`. 

#### Final file compose.yml
```sh
version: “3.7”
services:
  wg-easy:
    image: ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy
    container_name: wg-easy
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - etc_wireguard:/etc/wireguard
    environment:
      - LANG=en
      - WG_HOST=178.125.85.124
      - PASSWORD_HASH=$$$2a$$12$$$o1s1n4ruKZ/2RbnVOUoHOutLY6raO4IDZv7/5z/Qh.K0UbA8RyaVG
      - UI_TRAFFIC_STATS=true
      - UI_CHART_TYPE=3
      - WG_PORT=49888
      - PORT=48999
      - WG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS=10.45.0.x
      - WG_DEFAULT_DNS=1.1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8.8
      - WG_ALLOWED_IPS=0.0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
      - WG_PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVE=25
      # - WG_PRE_UP=echo “Pre Up” > /etc/wireguard/pre-up.txt
      # - WG_POST_UP=echo “Post Up” > /etc/wireguard/post-up.txt
      # - WG_PRE_DOWN=echo “Pre Down” > /etc/wireguard/pre-down.txt
      # - WG_POST_DOWN=echo “Post Down” > /etc/wireguard/post-down.txt
      - WG_ENABLE_ONE_TIME_LINKS=true
      - UI_ENABLE_SORT_CLIENTS=true
      - WG_ENABLE_EXPIRES_TIME=true
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    network_mode: host
volumes:
  etc_wireguard:
```

## Change the variables in the compose.yml file to suit your needs

- In the `- LANG=ru` environment variable you can change the interface language to en, ua, ru, tr, no, pl, fr, de, ca, es, ko, vi, nl, is, pt, chs, cht, it, th, hi, ja, si.
- In the `- PORT=48999` environment variable, you can change a convenient port, for example, take free ones from 48658-48999, or from 49001-49150. 
- In the environment variable `- WG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS=10.45.0.x` you can change the second octet of the address, to 8 or 6. We get: `10.8.0.x` or `10.6.0.x`. After entering the required data, save the file compose.yml.

## Add rules to the iptables firewall and enable IP Forward

```sh
cat net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```
```sh
sudo sysctl -p
```

To add the rules correctly, you need to put the name of your interface in the command.
Output the list of interfaces, state, address:
```sh
ip -br a
```

We get:
| `Interface`     | Status | IPv4/IPv6 address                |
|---------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| lo            | UNKNOWN| 127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128               |
| `enp0s3`        | UP     | 192.168.1.12/24 fe80::a00:27ff:fe90:fe8d/64 |
| docker0       | DOWN   | 172.17.0.1/16 fe80::42:abff:febb:86ce/64 |
| docker_gwbridge | UP   | 172.20.0.1/16 fe80::42:31ff:fe46:73b3/64 |
| veth4550803@if8 | UP   | fe80::a404:7ff:fed5:585e/64      |
| veth8d014ec@if22 | UP | fe80::1ca2:29ff:feee:9a00/64      |

Now add commands to the terminal: 
```sh
sudo iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING 1 -s 10.8.0.0.0/24 -o YOUR_INTERFACE -j MASQUERADE
```
where, `10.8.0.0.0/24` is your IP address from the environment variable `- WG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS=10.8.0.x` AND `eth0` the name of your interface.
Example:
```sh
sudo iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING 1 -s 10.45.0.0.0/24 -o enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE
```
Next, you need to substitute your interface by analogy and apply each command:

```sh
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i wg0 -j ACCEPT
```
```sh
sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i YOUR_INTERFACE -o wg0 -j ACCEPT
```
```sh
sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -i wg0 -o YOUR_INTERFACE -j ACCEPT
```
```sh
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i YOUR_INTERFACE -p udp --dport 49888 -j ACCEPT
```

## Start the server

```sh
cd vpn-wireguard/
```
```sh
docker compose up -d 
```

## Start the Web interface

Go to the browser and enter the IP address of the host from the variable `- WG_HOST=XXX.XXX.XXX` with a colon after the address, and the port number from the variable `- PORT=XXXX`. Пример: http://178.125.85.124:48999.
We get to the main password entry page, enter the password that was created with hash string. The interface will open, click `+ Create` or `+ Create Client` and enter the name, the configuration is ready. Each client has an on/off tubler, a QR code key for skinning, a load configuration key, and a delete client key.
